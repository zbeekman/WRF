# How to install required libraries for WRF-CMake
The following libraries are required on your system to install WRF-CMake from source: [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [JasPer](https://www.ece.uvic.ca/~frodo/jasper/), [libpng](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html), [libjpeg](http://libjpeg.sourceforge.net/), [zlib](https://zlib.net/), [HDF5](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/), [NetCDF-C](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/index.jsp), [NetCDF-Fortran](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/index.jsp), and MPI (required if building in `dmpar` or `dm+sm` mode).

For the installation of libraries, we rely on your system's package managers (APT, YUM, Homebrew). We assume that you have administrative privileges on your computer. If you do not have administrative privileges you should request these libraries to be installed by your system administrator so that they can tare of this for you and manage updates on your behalf.

## Ubuntu

### Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty)
To install all the required dependencies, including support for MPI, run the following commands from your terminal prompt:

```sh
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install -y git cmake3 gfortran libnetcdf-dev libpng-dev libjasper-dev libmpich-dev
```

After the installtion is complete, you can go back to [Build and Install WRF-CMake](README_CMAKE_INSTALL.md#build-and-install-wrf-cmake).

### 16.04 LTS (Xenial)
To install all the required dependencies, including support for MPI, run the following commands from your terminal prompt:

```sh
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install -y git cmake gfortran libnetcdf-dev libnetcdff-dev libpng-dev libjasper-dev libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev libmpich-dev
```

After the installtion is complete, you can go back to [Build and Install WRF-CMake](README_CMAKE_INSTALL.md#build-and-install-wrf-cmake).

### 18.04 LTS (Bionic)

To install all the required dependencies except for JasPer (installed manually, see below), including support for MPI, run the following commands from your terminal prompt:

```sh
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install -y git cmake gfortran libnetcdf-dev libnetcdff-dev libpng-dev libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev libmpich-dev
```

NOTE: `libjasper-dev` is currently not provided though APT and you will need to install it from source. For the moment, you can simply [download the latest version of JasPer](https://www.ece.uvic.ca/~frodo/jasper/#download) and install it manually from source. To do this you can use the following commands:

```
cd /tmp
wget https://www.ece.uvic.ca/~frodo/jasper/software/jasper-2.0.14.tar.gz
tar xvzf jasper-2.0.14.tar.gz
cd jasper-2.0.14/build/
cmake build ..
sudo make install
```

After the installtion is complete, you can go back to [Build and Install WRF-CMake](README_CMAKE_INSTALL.md#build-and-install-wrf-cmake).

## macOS

On macOS, we can use Homebrew to to install the required libraries. If you do not have Homebrew installed on your system, install it from [here](https://brew.sh/) then, to install all the required dependencies, including support for MPI, run the following commands from your terminal prompt:

```sh
brew update
brew install git cmake gcc netcdf jasper mpich
```

After the installtion is complete, you can go back to [Build and Install WRF-CMake](README_CMAKE_INSTALL.md#build-and-install-wrf-cmake).

## Windows
- Install the 64bit version of [MSYS2](http://www.msys2.org/)
- If you already have MSYS2 installed, make sure that you didn't compile and install any of WRF's dependencies within the **MSYS** shell, otherwise these might be picked up by accident within the **MinGW** shell. To be sure, use a fresh MSYS2 install.
- Inside the MSYS2 **MinGW 64-bit** shell, run `pacman -Syu`
- Restart the shell
- Run `pacman -Syu` again to finish upgrading
- Run `pacman -S --noconfirm --needed make unzip git mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-portablexdr`
- Run `pacman -S --noconfirm --needed mingw-w64-x86_64-libpng mingw-w64-x86_64-libjpeg-turbo mingw-w64-x86_64-jasper` (for WPS; or WRF with GRIB 2 support)
- Run `pacman -S --noconfirm --needed mingw-w64-x86_64-hdf5 mingw-w64-x86_64-libtool tar` (only needed for temporary netCDF compilation below)

Temporary netCDF installation instructions (until https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c/issues/554 and https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c/issues/1105 are resolved and the MinGW-w64 package is updated):
```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/WRF-CMake/netcdf-c.git -b mingw-support
cd netcdf-c
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_GENERATOR="MSYS Makefiles" -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF -DENABLE_TESTS=OFF -DENABLE_DAP=FALSE -DNC_FIND_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DBUILD_UTILITIES=OFF -DENABLE_EXAMPLES=OFF -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$MINGW_PREFIX ..
make install
rm -rf $MINGW_PREFIX/lib/cmake/netCDF # breaks for some reason otherwise in netcdf-fortran
rm -rf * # avoid cmake cache using this directly in netcdf-fortran
cd ~
wget ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/netcdf-fortran-4.4.4.tar.gz
tar xvzf netcdf-fortran-4.4.4.tar.gz
cd netcdf-fortran-4.4.4
sed -i 's/ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(examples)/#ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(examples)/' CMakeLists.txt
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_GENERATOR="MSYS Makefiles" -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DENABLE_TESTS=OFF -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$MINGW_PREFIX ..
make install
```

If you require MPI support you can continue with the section below, otherwise you can go back to [Build and Install WRF-CMake](README_CMAKE_INSTALL.md#build-and-install-wrf-cmake).

### Microsoft MPI support
The following MS MPI instructions originated from:
- http://www.math.ucla.edu/~wotaoyin/windows_coding.html
- https://github.com/coderefinery/autocmake/issues/85

Download and install both `msi` and `exe` from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56727.

Restart the MSYS2 **MinGW 64-bit** shell and run:
```sh
mkdir ~/msmpi && cd ~/msmpi
cp "$MSMPI_INC/mpi.h" .
sed -i '1s/^/#include <stdint.h>\n/' mpi.h
cp mpi.h $MINGW_PREFIX/include
cpp -P -nostdinc -traditional-cpp -DINT_PTR_KIND\(\)=8 "$MSMPI_INC/mpif.h" > $MINGW_PREFIX/include/mpif.h
cp "$MSMPI_INC/mpi.f90" mpi.F90
cp "$MSMPI_INC/x64/mpifptr.h" $MINGW_PREFIX/include
gfortran -c -fno-range-check -I$MINGW_PREFIX/include -DINT_PTR_KIND\(\)=8 mpi.F90
cp mpi.mod $MINGW_PREFIX/include
cd ~
```

Technical note: Preprocessing `mpif.h` is required as WRF `include`s this file instead of `#include` and then no preprocessing would take place.

The `~/msmpi` folder is not needed anymore and can now be removed.
```sh
rm -rf ~/msmpi
```

To verify that MPI is working correctly, run:
```sh
cd ~
mkdir mpi_test && cd mpi_test
# can run with and without MPI
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wesleykendall/mpitutorial/gh-pages/tutorials/mpi-hello-world/code/mpi_hello_world.c
# checks if MPI launches 2 processes
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coderefinery/autocmake/c5057f8aee65/test/fc_mpi/src/example.F90
gcc mpi_hello_world.c -D_WIN64 -lmsmpi -L"$MSMPI_LIB64" -o mpi_hello
gfortran -o example1 example.F90 -fno-range-check -lmsmpifec -lmsmpi -L"$MSMPI_LIB64" -I$MINGW_PREFIX/include
gfortran -o example2 -DUSE_MPI_MODULE example.F90 -fno-range-check -lmsmpifec -lmsmpi -L"$MSMPI_LIB64" -I$MINGW_PREFIX/include
./mpi_hello # 1 process
export PATH="$MSMPI_BIN":$PATH
mpiexec -n 4 mpi_hello.exe
mpiexec -n 2 example1.exe
mpiexec -n 2 example2.exe
```

If everything went OK, you can now build WRF with MPI. You can go back to [Build and Install WRF-CMake](README_CMAKE_INSTALL.md#build-and-install-wrf-cmake).
