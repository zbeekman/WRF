# All registry files are copied over to the build directory.
# This is necessary as the registry tool generates an additional file Registry/io_boilerplate_temporary.inc
# and it is not possible to specify search locations of include files to the tool.
# Therefore the tool is pointed to the main registry file inside the build folder where it can locate
# the generated file as well. See inc/CMakeLists.txt for details.
