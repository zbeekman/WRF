Default configurations
======================

This folder contains default configurations that are chosen automatically if no custom architecture file
is specified at configure time with -DARCH_CUSTOM=<custom-config>.
Depending on the user's operating system and default compiler, the corresponding configuration files are used.
Users can influence the compiler choice using the CC and FC environment variables.
Default configurations are meant to provide a zero-configuration quick start for the majority of users.
If unusual compiler flags are required for certain environments then custom architecture files should be used.

Compiler flags
--------------

New compiler configurations can be added by creating new files following the pattern:

COMPILER.cmake
COMPILER_OS.cmake
COMPILER_LANGUAGE.cmake
COMPILER_LANGUAGE_OS.cmake

COMPILER is one of the values in https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_LANG_COMPILER_ID.html.
LANGUAGE is C or Fortran.
OS is UNIX, Linux, Darwin (=macOS), or Windows (incl. MinGW).
For Linux and Darwin, UNIX can be used for flags common to those systems.

As an example, when using the GNU compiler (gcc/gfortran) on Linux the following files
are tested for existence and applied in the given order (general to specific) if they exist:

GNU.cmake
GNU_UNIX.cmake
GNU_Linux.cmake
GNU_C.cmake
GNU_C_UNIX.cmake
GNU_C_Linux.cmake
GNU_Fortran.cmake
GNU_Fortran_UNIX.cmake
GNU_Fortran_Linux.cmake

For C and Fortran, the following variables must at a minimum be defined after all available files have been applied:

set(debug "-g")
set(optimized "-O3 -funroll-loops")

'debug' defines the flag to generate debugging information and is used when compiling in Debug mode.
'optimized' defines the flags for optimizing code and is used when compiling in Release mode.
If OPTIMIZE_C is not disabled (enabled by default), then, for C only, 'optimized' is also used in Debug mode.

For Fortran, the following variables must at a minimum be defined after all available files have been applied:

set(preprocess "-cpp")
set(io "-fconvert=big-endian -frecord-marker=4")

'preprocess' defines the flag for enabling the preprocessor on Fortran files.
'io' defines the flags for Fortran unformatted I/O which for WRF should be big endian and 4 byte record length block size.

The following variables are optional:

set(checked "-fbounds-check") # Flags that enable additional run-time checks
set(temps "-save-temps") # Flag that enables saving of intermediate compiler files
set(other "-ffree-line-length-none") # Other flags not belonging into the above categories

'checked' is only used when compiling in Debug mode (or if -DENABLE_RUNTIME_CHECKS=ON),
'temps' only when specifically requested, and 'other' always.

Variables that are defined in less specific files can be replaced or extended in more specific files.
For example, in Intel_Fortran_UNIX.cmake the following is defined:

set(other "-fp-model precise")

In the more specific file Intel_Fortran_Darwin.cmake this variable is extended to
work around a bug only appearing on macOS systems:

set(other "${other} -fno-common")

Linker flags
------------

New optional linker configurations can be added by extending the following files
also used for compiler configurations:

COMPILER.cmake
COMPILER_OS.cmake

COMPILER is one of the values in https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_LANG_COMPILER_ID.html.
OS is UNIX, Linux, Darwin (=macOS), or Windows (incl. MinGW).
For Linux and Darwin, UNIX can be used for flags common to those systems.

As an example, when using the GNU compiler (gcc/gfortran) on Linux the following files
are tested for existence and applied in the given order (general to specific) if they exist:

GNU.cmake
GNU_UNIX.cmake
GNU_Linux.cmake

The only variable for applying additional linker flags is 'linker'.

set(linker "-stack_addr 0xF10000000 -stack_size 0x64000000")

As for compiler configurations, variables that are defined in less specific files can be
replaced or extended in more specific files.
