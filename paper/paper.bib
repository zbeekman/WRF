@article{Geer2016,
abstract = {The impact of developments in weather forecasting is measured using forecast verification, but many developments, though useful, have impacts of less than 0.5 {\%} on medium-range forecast scores. Chaotic variability in the quality of individual forecasts is so large that it can be hard to achieve statistical significance when comparing these ‘smaller' developments to a control. For example, with 60 separate forecasts and requiring a 95 {\%} confidence level, a change in quality of the day-5 forecast needs to be larger than 1 {\%} to be statistically significant using a Student's t-test. The first aim of this study is simply to illustrate the importance of significance testing in forecast verification, and to point out the surprisingly large sample sizes that are required to attain significance. The second aim is to see how reliable are current approaches to significance testing, following suspicion that apparently significant results may actually have been generated by chaotic variability.
